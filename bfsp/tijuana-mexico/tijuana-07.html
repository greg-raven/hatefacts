			<h2>
				Tijuana <small>Part 7</small>
			</h2>
			<p>
				In one such &ldquo;situation&rdquo; the Mexican Federal Judicial Police encountered a hundred Baja California State Judicial Police who were also engaged (after hours, of course) as personal bodyguards for The Cartel&rsquo;s leader Javier Arellano Felix. Thousands of bullets buzzed through the air. Bodies lay scattered and dribbling various fluids in the warm hazy sunlight. Javier Arellano Felix &mdash; &ldquo;El Se&ntilde;or, or also known as, &ldquo;El Min&rdquo; &mdash; survived the event.
				<p>
					In another situation two Mexican Federal Police agents were gunned down right on the Tijuana courthouse steps after they had testified in a legal matter concerning The Cartel and some of these highly refined agricultural products.

				<p>
					This diversity even sends bullets into California&rsquo;s Border Field State Park and lend excitement to an otherwise boring day at the beach.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Arellano F&eacute;lix Cartel may be the most lethal criminal organization within 5,000 miles of the U.S. / Mexico border but that does not mean it&rsquo;s perfect. The Cartel&rsquo;s Efra&iacute;n P&eacute;rez Pazuenga, Jorge Aureliano F&eacute;lix, and seven of their accomplices were recently passengers in an armored convoy rumbling through Tijuana&rsquo;s Zona Rio high class district on their way to serious prison time. Sr. Jos&eacute; Manuel Ayala Mora, an homicide detective for the state of Baja California; Alfonso Escobedo Villalvazo, a former Baja California Police agent; and Alberto Antonio G&oacute;mez, a former federal police agent were included in this handcuffed parade.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Cartel has had issues with the editors of the local Tijuana newspapers. We all must agree that a tendentious Letter To The Editor has little weight when compared to launching a fusillade of 300 machine gun bullets through the newspaper&rsquo;s front door.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Tijuana weekly paper Zeta was brought to task for its editorial stand when the paper&rsquo;s editor was wounded and his bodyguard ascended to immortality during an early morning discussion. A squad of young adults surrounded their car and perforated it in a vast number of places. The youths were so enthusiastic in their interplay that they accidentally whacked one of their own in this flurry of bee-like whizzing of bullets and clouds of cordite smoke.
				</p>
				<p>
					With The Cartel taking serious pressure at the top of U.S. DEA&rsquo;s Hit List, the lesser ranking drug organizations are more active in the city. The Ismael &ldquo;Mayo&rdquo; Zambada drug cartel is now taking control of certain segments of drug operations in Tijuana.

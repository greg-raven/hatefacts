				The Tijuana River Estuary Interpretive Center <small>Part 2</small>
			</h2>
			<p>
				While their very own government brochure says: &ldquo;Equestrian trails are available on the south end of the Reserve, and horses can be rented from neighboring stables.&rdquo; The reality is (of course) that these very government agencies have done their utmost to bankrupt these &ldquo;neighboring stables&rdquo; and to drive them completely out of the area.
			</p>
			<p>
				So there are no horses to rent and if you try to bring your own horse to this place there is a great likelihood that your horse trailer will sink up to its hubcaps in the well seasoned and germ laded earth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Much of the funding for this place comes from various federal &ldquo;programs&rdquo; which include those for educating children in &ldquo;estuarine ecology&rdquo; and &ldquo;environmental border issues.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				The visitor center offers parking for twenty cars but most of the parking places are filled with white government vehicles. The parking area is constructed not of a hard surface but instead of large stone gravel. The reason for the gravel is that the parking lot may well continue to &ldquo;settle&rdquo; and hard pavement would crack (i.e. sink).
			</p>

			<p>
				A quick calculation shows that there are about a quarter million dollars in government vehicles parked here at any moment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since one person can&rsquo;t drive more than one vehicle at a time, that indicates there have to be at least ten or fifteen government employees someplace around here all the time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The average burdened labor rate of $100,000 a year makes this place a one to two million dollar a year eco-toy funded directly or indirectly by the taxpayer.

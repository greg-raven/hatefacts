						August 2, 2012 &mdash; Thousands of violent crimes are being committed by criminal aliens who have been <em>arrested but then released back into the population.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						This week, the Congressional Research Service released a report showing that the federal policy of releasing criminal aliens back into the population, as opposed to deporting them promptly, has created a virtual alien crime wave across America.
					</p>
					<p>
						We now know that the &ldquo;catch-and-release&rdquo; program has aided thousands of criminals.
					</p>
					<p>
						The shocking revelation from this official government report are: Criminal aliens (legal as well as illegal) have committed over 4,000 &ldquo;major crimes&rdquo; such as murder, rape, assault, and kidnapping in the past four years. The released aliens also committed 8,500 DUIs, over 6,000 drug violations, and 3,000 thefts. Other crimes committed by the released aliens: Lynching, child molestation, stalking, and torture. The aliens committed over 57,000 crimes in all!
					</p>
					<p>
						You&rsquo;re probably asking, &ldquo;Why is the government releasing criminal aliens it has already captured?&rdquo; The answer is that the Obama administration has been extremely slack in immigration enforcement. Local police automatically submit fingerprints of arrested persons to the FBI to check against federal databases. If the criminals are found to be illegal aliens, police are required to hold them for 48 hours, till ICE picks them up. What happens? No one shows up to pick up the aliens.
					</p>
					<p>
						ICE union president Chris Crane told reporters last week that &ldquo;catch and release&rdquo; was now being worsened by Obama&rsquo;s DREAM Amnesty decree. &ldquo;Officers have been told that there is no burden for the alien to prove anything,&rdquo; Crane explained. &ldquo;Our orders are if an alien says they went to high school, then let them go,&rdquo; he stated.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, catch and release has several causes: Too few detention beds, reluctance to deport younger illegal aliens, occasional lack of cooperation by local officials, general disinterest by everybody. The bottom line is that criminal aliens often walk. The aliens are supposed to appear at hearings later to begin their deportation process. But of course, most never show up. The first place many actually appear is in the pages of newspapers, after they have shot, stabbed, robbed, raped, driven drunk, or stolen property.

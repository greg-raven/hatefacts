						This information is compiled from FBI stats. Keep in mind that the FBI has a class for Hispanic victims, but NO class for Hispanic criminals. This means that Hispanic crimes are lumped in with white crime, which makes white crime seem much worse than it is, and hides the huge amount of Hispanic crime.

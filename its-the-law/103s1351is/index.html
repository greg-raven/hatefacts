        the alien excluded from the United States without further
        hearing or review.

        examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking
        entry is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to enter, the
        alien shall be detained for a hearing before a special inquiry
        officer.

        challenged, before a special inquiry officer for a hearing on
        exclusion of the alien.
            ``(5)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), an alien has not

        the United States that any excludable or deportable alien who
        is to depart the United States to such country under an order
        of deportation, under a grant of voluntary departure with
        safeguards, or at a time when the alien is in federal custody
        shall be transported to a point in the contiguous country that,
        to the extent practicable, is not less than 500 kilometers from
        the border of the United States.''.
    (b) Grounds for Exclusion.--Section 221(a)(6) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act is amended by adding the following paragraphs:
            ``(G)(i) Any alien who, in seeking entry to the United
        States or boarding a common carrier for the purpose of coming
        to the United States, presents any document which is forged,
        counterfeit, altered, falsely made, stolen, or inapplicable to
        the alien presenting the document, or otherwise contains a
        misrepresentation of a material fact, shall be excluded.
            ``(ii) Subparagraph (ii) shall not apply to an alien if, in
        the determination of the asylum officer, the document or
        documents to which that subparagraph refers were presented by
        the alien solely to enable the alien to depart directly from--
                    ``(A) a country in which the alien had a credible
                fear of persecution; or
                    ``(B) a country in which there was a significant
                danger that the alien would be returned to a country in
                which the alien would have a credible fear of
                persecution.
            ``(iii) For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term
        `credible fear of persecution' means (I) that it is more
        probable than not that the statements made by the alien in
        support of his or her claim are true, and (II) that there is a
        significant possibility, in light of such statements and of
        such other facts as are known to the officer that the alien
        could establish eligibility for asylum under section 208.
            ``(H) Any alien who, in boarding a common carrier for the
        purpose of coming to the United States, presents a document
        that relates or purports to relate to the alien's eligibility
        to enter the United States, and fails to present such document
        to an immigration officer upon arrival at a port of entry into
        the United States, shall be excluded.''.

                    ``(A) Grants by attorney general.--The Attorney

                applies for asylum in accordance with the requirements
                of this section and establishes that it is more
                probable than not that in the alien's country of
                nationality (or, in the case of a person having no
                nationality, the country in which such alien last
                habitually resided) such alien would be arrested and
                incarcerated or such alien's life would be threatened
                on account of race, religion, nationality, membership
                in a particular social group, or political opinion.
                    ``(B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply

                        nationality, membership in a particular social
                        group, or political opinion;
                            ``(ii) the alien, having been convicted by
                        a final judgment of a particularly serious
                        crime, constitutes a danger to the community of
                        the United States;

resides and may be brought at any time on or before the date that is 5

public charge. The bond shall be in such amount and shall contain such
conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe. The bond shall

States, (2) the death of an alien, or (3) the expiration of the period

Social Security account number data base (NUMIDENT) as are practicable
and enable confirmation through the telephone verification system
described in subsection (d) that a Social Security account number has
been issued to an individual identified by last name, sex, year of
birth, and place of birth and that such individual is not known to the
Secretary of Health and Human Services to be an alien not authorized to
work in the United States. At a minimum the data base shall be modified
to enable confirmation that a Social Security account number is not
assigned to an individual authorized to work in the United States
because the number--
            (1) has not been issued,
            (2) was issued to an individual known by the Secretary of
        Health and Human Services as not authorized to work,

        been reissued, or
            (4) was issued to an alien that any data base of the
        Immigration and Naturalization Service shows is not authorized
        to work in the United States.
The Attorney General shall provide such assistance as the Secretary of
Health and Human Services may require to merge or otherwise make use of
any data base of the Immigration and Naturalization Service for the
purposes of this section.
    (b) Exchange of Information.--The Attorney General shall notify the
Secretary of Health and Human Services of the expiration of an alien's
authorization to work in the United States not later than 14 calendar
days after the date of expiration. The Secretary of Health and Human
Services shall furnish the Attorney General with a list of any aliens
for whom confirmation of work eligibility has been requested not later
than 5 calendar days after such request. Such list shall include the
telephone number from which the request was made and the employer
identification number of the requester.
    (c) Adult Applicants.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services
shall furnish to the Attorney General a copy of any application
(including supporting documentation) for a Social Security account
number by an alien or by an individual over 16 years of age who claims
to be a United States citizen or national and shall not issue a number
before the earlier of the following dates:
            (1) The date on which the Attorney General confirms in
        writing that his records do not show that the applicant is an
        alien unauthorized to work in the United States.
            (2) 60 days after a copy of the application and supporting
        documentation has been delivered to the Attorney General.
    (d) Telephone Verification System.--Before January 1, 1995, the
Secretary of Health and Human Services shall test and place in
operation a system whereby an employer can report by touch-tone
telephone his employer identification number and the Social Security
account number, last name, sex, year of birth, and place of birth of
any individual who is to be employed and can receive immediate
confirmation that the number was issued to the individual having that
identity and that such person is not identified within the Social
Security account number data base as an individual who is not a United
States citizen, a United States national, or an alien authorized to
work in the United States. The charge for each call will be sufficient
to cover the costs of operating the system, except that it shall not
exceed $2 plus any line charges payable to the telephone carrier. The
system shall provide for access to a live operator if an entry is not
accepted or confirmed, shall provide a verification code to the caller,
shall create and maintain a record of each inquiry (including the
telephone number of the requester) and its verification code for not
less than two years, and shall accommodate devices that read the
magnetic strip incorporated by a card issued under section 601.
    (e) Abuse of System.--The use of the telephone verification system
established by subsection (d) by a person other than--
            (1) an employer acting pursuant to Section 274A(b)(1) of
        the Immigration and Nationality Act, or
            (2) an officer or employee of an agency of the United
        States or of any State acting in the performance of official
        duties,
shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 per occurrence.

statistics records of such States. The network shall provide, where
practical, for the matching of deaths with births and shall enable the
confirmation of births and deaths of citizens of the United States, or
of aliens within the United States, by any Federal or State agency or
official in the performance of official duties. The Secretary shall
institute measures to achieve uniform and accurate reporting of vital
statistics into the national network, to protect the integrity of the
registration and certification process, and to prevent fraud against
the Government and other persons through the use of false birth or
death certificates.

SEC. 704. RESPONSIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL CARRIERS.

    (A) In General.--Section 273 of the Immigration and Nationality Act
(8 U.S.C. 1323) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``(other than from
        foreign contiguous territory)'';
            (2) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections
        (e) and (f), respectively;
            (3) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:
    ``(c) Records.--The Attorney General shall maintain a record of
each undocumented alien arriving on or after the date of enactment of
this subsection at a United States port of entry and of the carrier
which brought such alien to that port of entry.'';
            (4) by inserting after subsection (c) (as added by
        paragraph (4)), the following:
    ``(d) Repeat Offenses.--(1) If the Attorney General determines
that, during the preceding calendar year, any carrier has delivered an
average of more than 0.5 undocumented aliens per arrival at United
States ports of entry then, for the next calendar year, in lieu of the
penalty of $3,000 specified in subsection (b), such carrier shall pay
to the Attorney General a penalty of $10,000 for each alien brought in
violation of subsection (a) or, alternatively, such carrier may choose
to participate in a 1-year pilot program intended to reduce the number
of undocumented aliens arriving at United States ports of entry via
international carriers. If such international carrier chooses to
participate in the 1-year pilot program, that carrier will be subject
to the penalty levels prescribed in subsection (b), rather than the
increased penalty levels specified in this subsection, for each alien
brought in violation of subsection (a). The 1-year pilot program, which
can be extended for multiple years at the discretion of the Attorney
General, shall consist of a program whereby the international carrier
collects the travel documents necessary for entry into the United
States from all passengers upon their entry to the carrier and
physically returns them to the passengers on an individual basis only
at the actual point of inspection at the United States port of entry by
United States immigration officials.
    ``(2) If the Attorney General determines that, during the preceding
calendar year, any carrier has delivered an average of more than 1.5
undocumented aliens per arrival at United States ports of entry, then,
for the next calendar year, in lieu of the penalties specified in
subsection (b) and in paragraph (1) of this subsection, such carrier
shall pay to the Attorney General a penalty of $20,000 for each alien
brought in violation of subsection (a).
    ``(3) If the Attorney General determines that, in the preceding
calendar year, any carrier has delivered an average of more than 2
undocumented aliens per arrival at United States ports of entry, then
such carrier shall forfeit all landing rights in the United States for
the next calendar year.''; and
            (5) subsection (e) (as redesignated) is amended--
                    (A) by inserting after ``refunded.'' the following:
                ``Unless the alien transported is granted political
                asylum status in the United States or''; and
                    (B) by inserting before the period at the end
                thereof ``or that the visa or other immigration
                documentation presented to the carrier was forged,

                      TITLE IX--LOCAL COOPERATION

SEC. 901. SAVE SYSTEM MANDATED.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal financial
assistance shall be paid to a State or local government or agency for
the aid to families with dependent children program under subchapter IV
of title 42 United States Code, the medicaid program under subchapter
XIX of title 42 United States Code, the unemployment compensation

                          TITLE X--CITIZENSHIP

SEC. 1001. BASIS OF CITIZENSHIP CLARIFIED.

    In the exercise of its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth
Article of Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the
Congress has determined and hereby declares that any person born after
the date of enactment of this title to a mother who is neither a
citizen of the United States nor admitted to the United States as a
lawful permanent resident, and which person is a national or citizen of
another country of which either of his or her natural parents is a
national or citizen, or is entitled upon application to become a
national or citizen of such country, shall be considered as born
subject to the jurisdiction of that foreign country and not subject to
the jurisdiction of the United States within the meaning of section 1
of such Article and shall therefore not be a citizen of the United
States or of any State solely by reason of physical presence within the
United States at the moment of birth.

SEC. 1002. VOTING LIMITED TO CITIZENS.

    In the exercise of its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth
Article of Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to
enforce the prohibition of section 1 of such Article against the making
or enforcing of any law that shall abridge the privileges or immunities
of citizens of the United States, the Congress determines that the
right of citizens to vote is a privilege of citizens of the United
States and that voting in elections of the United States or of any
State by persons who are not citizens of the United States is an
abridgement of that privilege. It shall be unlawful, and a felony
punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 and/or imprisonment of
not more than 1 year for each unlawful vote, for any person who is not
a citizen of the United States to vote in any election to which the
provisions of the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, or Twenty-Sixth
Article of Amendment to the Constitution applies or in any other
election, referendum, ballot, or other procedure of the United States
or of any State in which votes are taken. Any vote that is cast in
violation of this section shall be null, void, and of no effect and
shall not be counted.

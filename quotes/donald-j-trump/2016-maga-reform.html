						<strong><em>The three core principles of Donald J. Trump&rsquo;s immigration plan</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						When politicians talk about &ldquo;immigration reform&rdquo; they mean: amnesty, cheap labor and open borders. The Schumer-Rubio immigration bill was nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties.
					</p>
					<p>
						Real immigration reform puts the needs of working people first &mdash; not wealthy globetrotting donors. We are the only country in the world whose immigration system puts the needs of other nations ahead of our own. That must change. Here are the three core principles of real immigration reform:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li> <strong>A nation without borders is not a nation.</strong> There must be a wall across the southern border. </li>
						<li> <strong>A nation without laws is not a nation.</strong> Laws passed in accordance with our Constitutional system of government must be enforced. </li>
						<li> <strong> A nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation.</strong> Any immigration plan must improve jobs, wages and security for all Americans. </li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Make Mexico Pay For The Wall</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						For many years, Mexico&rsquo;s leaders have been taking advantage of the United States by using illegal immigration to export the crime and poverty in their own country (as well as in other Latin American countries). The costs for the United States have been extraordinary: U.S. taxpayers have been asked to pick up hundreds of billions in healthcare costs, housing costs, education costs, welfare costs, etc. Indeed, the annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011.
					</p>
					<p>
						Meanwhile, Mexico continues to make billions on not only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States back to Mexico ($22 billion in <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/08/02/remittances-to-mexico-up-73-pct-in-1st-half-2014/">2013 alone</a>).
					</p>
					<p>
						The cost of building a permanent border wall pales mightily in comparison to what American taxpayers spend every single year on dealing with the fallout of illegal immigration on their communities, schools and unemployment offices.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on all border crossing cards &mdash; of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States from Mexico [Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options]. We will not be taken advantage of anymore.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Defend The Laws And Constitution Of The United States</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						America will only be great as long as America remains a nation of laws that lives according to the Constitution. No one is above the law. The following steps will return to the American people the safety of their laws, which politicians have stolen from them:
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Triple the number of ICE officers.</strong> As the President of the ICE Officers&rsquo; Council explained in Congressional testimony: &ldquo;Only approximately 5,000 officers and agents within ICE perform the lion&rsquo;s share of ICE&rsquo;s immigration mission &hellip; Compare that to the Los Angeles Police Department at approximately 10,000 officers. Approximately 5,000 officers in ICE cover 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam, and are attempting to enforce immigration law against 11 million illegal aliens already in the interior of the United States.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Nationwide <a href="/e-verify/index.html">E-Verify</a>.</strong> This simple measure will protect jobs for unemployed Americans.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Mandatory return of all criminal aliens.</strong> The Obama Administration has released 76,000 aliens from its custody with criminal convictions since 2013 alone. All criminal aliens must be returned to their home countries, a process which can be aided by canceling any visas to foreign countries which will not accept their own criminals, and making it a separate and additional crime to commit an offense while here illegally.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Detention &mdash; not catch-and-release.</strong> Illegal aliens apprehended crossing the border must be detained until they are sent home, no more catch-and-release.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Defund sanctuary cities. </strong>Cut-off federal grants to any city which refuses to cooperate with federal law enforcement.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Enhanced penalties for overstaying a visa.</strong> Individuals who refuse to leave at the time their visa expires should be subject to criminal penalties; this will also help give local jurisdictions the power to hold visa overstays until federal authorities arrive. Completion of a visa tracking system &mdash; required by law but blocked by lobbyists &mdash; will be necessary as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Cooperate with local gang task forces. </strong>ICE officers should accompany local police departments conducting raids of violent street gangs like <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/11/violent-gang-ms-13-taking-advantage-immigration-cr/" target="_blank">MS-13</a> and the <a href="http://www.newson6.com/story/10597491/27-members-associates-of-the-18th-street-gang-arrested-on-firearms-drug-and-immigration-charges" target="_blank">18th street gang</a>, which have terrorized the country. All illegal aliens in gangs should be apprehended and deported.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>End birthright citizenship. </strong>This remains the biggest magnet for illegal immigration. <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/new_high_65_oppose_automatic_citizenship_for_children_born_here_to_illegal_immigrants" target="_blank">By a 2:1 margin</a>, voters say it&rsquo;s the wrong policy, including Harry Reid who said &ldquo;no sane country&rdquo; would give automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Put American Workers First</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, we need to stop giving legal immigrant visas to people bent on causing us harm. From the 9/11 hijackers, to the Boston Bombers, and many others, our immigration system is being used to attack us. The President of the immigration caseworkers union declared <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/09/18/immigration-agents-isis-may-exploit-america-s-weakened-immigration-system-to-attack-the-u-s/" target="_blank">in a statement on ISIS</a>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve become the visa clearinghouse for the world.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs</strong>. We graduate <a href="http://issues.org/29-4/what-shortages-the-real-evidence-about-the-stem-workforce/" target="_blank">two times more Americans with STEM degrees</a> each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program&rsquo;s lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Requirement to hire American workers first</strong>. Too many visas, <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Hira%20Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">like the H-1B</a>, have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2014/12/03/median-household-income-is-falling-because-people-are-working-less/" target="_blank">incomes collapsing</a>, we need to companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>End welfare abuse.</strong> Applicants for entry to the United States should be required to certify that they can pay for their own housing, healthcare and other needs before coming to the U.S.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Jobs program for inner city youth. </strong>The J-1 visa <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/18/174410945/u-s-probes-abuse-allegations-under-worker-visa-program" target="_blank">jobs program for foreign youth</a> will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Refugee program for American children.</strong> Increase standards for the admission of refugees and asylum-seekers to <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/index.cfm/hearings?Id=FCA53ADA-367F-4613-B9CB-65732CE4B487&amp;Statement_id=65006558-96AD-4962-BA37-71E4B55E64DF" target="_blank">crack down on abuses</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Immigration moderation.</strong> Before any new green cards are issued to foreign workers abroad, there will be a pause where employers will have to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed immigrant and native workers.

						Here are a few more anti-immigration quotes from liberals who have since sold out.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							<q>The parade of evils caused by illegal immigration is widely known, and it gets worse every day. In short, illegal immigration wreaks havoc economically, socially, and culturally; makes a mockery of the rule of law; and is disgraceful just on basic fairness grounds alone. Few people dispute this, and yet nothing is done.</q>
						</p>
						<small>Glenn Greenwald, November 2005</small>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							<q>[I]mmigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants. That&rsquo;s just supply and demand: We&rsquo;re talking about large increases in the number of low-skill workers relative to other inputs into production, so it&rsquo;s inevitable that this means a fall in wages. [&hellip;] the fiscal burden of low-wage immigrants is also pretty clear.</q>
						</p>
						<small>Paul Krugman, March 2006</small>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							<q>Realistically, we&rsquo;ll need to reduce the inflow of low-skill immigrants. Mainly that means better controls on illegal immigration.</q>
						</p>
						<small>Paul Krugman, March 2006</small>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							<q>We cannot continue to allow people to enter the United States undetected, undocumented, and unchecked. The American people are a welcoming and generous people, but those who enter our country&rsquo;s borders illegally, and those who employ them, disrespect the rule of the law.</q>
						</p>
						<small>Democrat Party&rsquo;s 2008 platform</small>
					</blockquote>

						February 2nd is the anniversary of one of the greatest victories in our history &mdash; the American victory in the Mexican War and the <a href="/its-the-law/index.html">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a>. It was this victory that gave us the American Southwest and let us say that our country stretches from &ldquo;sea to shining sea.&rdquo;
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, politicians today &mdash; both Republican and Democrat &mdash; are doing their best to give away what Americans of the past purchased with their blood. Our borders are utterly undefended. Illegal immigrants parade under foreign flags in some of our greatest cities.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let us today as we celebrate, commemorate, and defend what is ours.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Celebrate:</b> What we won was largely empty desert. What our people have built is an economic and technological powerhouse that is the envy of the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Commemorate:</b> The great victory in the Mexican War that set the foundation for great American victories of the future. Show the world that we are still the same people who won the Mexican War.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Defend:</b> The historic American nation. Send a message to Washington that we won&rsquo;t give up our country.

							As of today, illegal aliens have murdered more than <span id="number1"></span> persons inside the USA in <span id="number2"></span> alone.

						The two lines above update every day. These are losses for which there can be no reimbursement.

						Notice that these approximations do not take into account the many rapes, child molestations, assaults, and other human crimes committed by illegal aliens, nor does it account for the property crimes and destruction of our environment (including our wildernesses, and state and national parks). Also, this total is artificially low because the medical system in our country still has the ability to save numerous persons who would otherwise died of their injuries. Neither does this show other costs &mdash; such as hospital costs &mdash; or other damage to our infrastructure caused by illegal aliens. Nor does it show the virtual destruction of the rule of law in this country, as self-serving politicians and special-interest groups support more and more hand-outs for illegal aliens, along with less enforcement of our existing laws.

						To put these numbers in perspective, illegal aliens kill more persons in the U.S. every week than we lost in the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in April 1995. Every six months, illegal aliens kill more persons in the U.S. than all in all the terrorists attacks against U.S. targets by all terrorists combined since the term &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; was coined to describe enemies of America 25 years ago. Compare these figures against those for <a href="/terror-chronology/index.html">all U.S. deaths at the hands of terrorists for the last 25 years</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						This killing goes on day after day after day: Seven days a week, 365 days a year, year after year after year.
